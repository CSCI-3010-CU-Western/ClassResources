Is the code understandable? (good variable names, appropriate comments, etc)
Does it compile? Does it run as it should?
Make sure that it is appropriate for the repository
Style consistency with the code base
Make sure there aren't "bad" files being added
Big library dependencies (in general)
Compiled code (no executables, no .o files)
No binary files
Is the code adequately tested?
